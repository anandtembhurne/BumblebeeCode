/**
 * Constructs a meta-index of the specified jar files. The meta-index contains prefixes of packages contained in these
 * jars, indexed by the jar file name. It is intended to be consumed by the JVM to allow the boot class loader to be
 * made lazier. For example, when class data sharing is enabled, the presence of the meta-index allows the JVM to skip
 * opening rt.jar if all of the dependent classes of the application are in the shared archive. A similar mechanism
 * could be useful at the application level as well, for example to make the extension class loader lazier.
 * <p>
 * The contents of the meta-index file for jre/lib look something like this:
 * 
 * <PRE>
 * % VERSION 2
 * # charsets.jar
 * sun/
 * # jce.jar
 * javax/
 * ! jsse.jar
 * sun/
 * com/sun/net/
 * javax/
 * com/sun/security/
 * # management-agent.jar
 * ! rt.jar
 * org/w3c/
 * com/sun/image/
 * com/sun/org/
 * com/sun/imageio/
 * com/sun/accessibility/
 * javax/
 * ...
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * It is a current invariant of the code in the JVM which consumes the meta-index that the meta-index indexes only jars
 * in one directory. It is acceptable for jars in that directory to not be mentioned in the meta-index. The meta-index
 * is designed more to be able to perform a quick rejection test of the presence of a particular class in a particular
 * jar file than to be a precise index of the contents of the jar.
