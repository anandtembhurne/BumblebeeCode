# About nuxeo-runtime-metrics


Since Nuxeo 5.7 Coda Hale Yammer Metrics is used to add metrics to Nuxeo.
This module is here to configure the metrics reporter and add
default metrics.

You can find an example of a json graphite dashboard to monitor Nuxeo in the
graphite directory. To use it from Graphite Dashboard > Edit Dashboard, paste
/bin/bash: q : commande introuvable
graph and add you own.

See <http://doc.nuxeo.org/> for full documentation.
